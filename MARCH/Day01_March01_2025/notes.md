# March Learning Plan: DevOps, Generative AI, and Blockchain

## Week 1: DevOps Fundamentals

### **March 1: Introduction to DevOps**

#### **Step 1: Understanding DevOps**
- Read "The Phoenix Project" (optional) and "DevOps Handbook" to gain an overview of DevOps culture, practices, and benefits.
- Research key DevOps concepts: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Monitoring.

#### **Step 2: Setting Up a Virtual Machine**
1. **Choose a Method:** Decide whether to use Vagrant (local) or a cloud instance (AWS, Azure, GCP).
2. **For Vagrant Users:**
   - Install Vagrant and VirtualBox.
   - Initialize a Vagrant project (`vagrant init`), configure the `Vagrantfile`, and start the VM (`vagrant up`).
   - SSH into the VM (`vagrant ssh`) and verify the setup.
3. **For Cloud Instance Users:**
   - Choose a cloud provider and create a virtual machine (EC2, Compute Engine, etc.).
   - Set up SSH access and basic security configurations.
   - Install essential DevOps tools like Git, Docker, and Terraform.

#### **Step 3: Researching CI/CD Pipeline Basics**
- Understand the key components: source code repository (GitHub/GitLab), build automation (Jenkins/GitHub Actions), testing, and deployment.
- Research different CI/CD tools and their workflows.
- Identify best practices for automating software delivery.

#### **Bonus Challenge:**
- Try setting up a simple Git repository and pushing code to get familiar with version control.
