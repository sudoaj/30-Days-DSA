# Major Milestones from the Chat

## 1. Project Initialization and Setup
- Established the foundation for a Django-based Wordle project.
- Defined core project requirements, focusing on gameplay mechanics and user interactivity.

---

## 2. Creating Automation Scripts
- Developed scripts for:
  - Creating a Django superuser automatically.
  - Resetting migrations and clearing the database.
  - Automating the creation of fake players for testing purposes.

---

## 3. Wordle Game Logic
- Designed and implemented the main game logic:
  - The `home` view to welcome users and guide them to start the game.
  - The `todays_game` view to handle gameplay and guess validation.
  - Integrated the `DailyWord`, `Guess`, and `Player` models into the gameplay.

---

## 4. Dynamic Frontend Interactions
- Incorporated JavaScript for dynamic interactions:
  - Real-time updating of the game board as users make guesses.
  - Handling keyboard inputs for adding/removing letters and submitting guesses.

---

## 5. Styling and UI Development
- Enhanced the gameâ€™s user interface:
  - Styled the Wordle tiles to reflect states like "correct," "present," and "absent."
  - Added responsiveness and aesthetic improvements using CSS.

---

## 6. Separation of Concerns
- Organized static files:
  - Moved CSS and JavaScript to dedicated files for better maintainability.
  - Linked them dynamically in templates using Django's `static` framework.

---

## 7. Backend Guess Validation
- Implemented a robust backend API (`validate_guess`) to:
  - Process and validate guesses.
  - Return detailed feedback on correctness.
  - Handle win/loss scenarios gracefully.

---

## 8. Testing Infrastructure
- Designed a comprehensive test suite in `tests.py`:
  - Tested core views (`home`, `todays_game`) for different scenarios.
  - Verified the correctness of `validate_guess` for valid and invalid inputs.

---

## 9. Production-Ready Enhancements
- Discussed best practices for:
  - Structuring a production-ready Django project.
  - Implementing user authentication, error handling, logging, and modular settings.

---

## 10. Project Documentation and Refinement
- Explored the importance of documentation for the project.
- Discussed creating a robust `README.md` and maintaining detailed inline documentation for clarity and collaboration.
